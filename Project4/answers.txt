Step 1

Q1 - 8 bits offset
Q2 - 8 bits VPN
Q3 - 0xBE - VPN
Q4 - 0xEF - offset

Step 2

Q5 - 0xDEAD -> 0xBEAD
Q6 - 0xF00D -> 0xD00D
Q7 - Not valid because valid bit not set

Step 3

Q8 - 10 * 100ns + 6 * 100ns + 2 * 10ms = 20.0016 ms
Q9 - (tlb_hits * mem_access_time + 2 * tlb_misses * mem_access_time + 2 * page_faults * mem_access_time + page_faults * disk_access_time) / num_mem_access

Step 4

Q10 - No, you should only choose to evict a frame whenever there are no free frames in physical memory. 
Q11 - Thrashing is when a process spends more time paging than actually computing. Thrashing is controlled by observing memory usage by the processes and decreasing the degree of multiprogramming if there is too much pressure on the memory.  

C, F, E, B, D
A, G

Step 5

Q12 - 0x42 will be used because it is the first page that has not been used
Q13 - 0xBE because it's used bit was cleared in the last question
Q14 - 0xBE because it is the first page that has not been used
